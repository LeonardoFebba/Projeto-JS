# Projeto-JS
Projeto final do curso de JavaScript

<h2>Hello everyone!</h2>

<p>I've decided to post this project. The CSS is something that's really taking a long time, but, the JS is functional!<br> I'll fix some bugs and problems, but you can check it out at: https://leonardofebba.github.io/Projeto-JS/</p>
